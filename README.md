# Lock Screen Explorer

A few lock screen designs for Omarchy 4 and a picker to preview and switch between them.
Colors and fonts come from your Omarchy theme.

![preview](preview.png)

Designs: Greeting Card, Classic (the stock one), Editorial, Zen, Split, Terminal, Ring, Poster, Dock, Aurora, Analog, Flip, Island, Cinema, Sheet, Neon, Calendar, Frame, Dayline, Profile, Weather, Music, System, Rain.

Weather fetches from wttr.in (same location as the bar widget), Music reads MPRIS players, System shows uptime, memory, load and battery.

Every password field has an eye button to show what you typed (Ctrl+E does the same). It hides again after a failed attempt or when the field is cleared.

## Install

```sh
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/SirJul1337/omarchy-lock-explorer.git --enable
omarchy restart shell
```

The restart is needed: the shell loads this service before it unloads the stock one, so for a
moment both claim the `lock` IPC target and the stock one keeps it. Until you restart,
`omarchy-shell lock explore` answers `Function not found`.

This replaces the built-in `omarchy.lock` service (the manifest has `clonedFrom: omarchy.lock`
so the shell swaps them and everything that locks the screen keeps working). Disable or remove
the plugin to get the stock lock screen back.

## Usage

```sh
omarchy-shell lock explore
```

Arrows to browse, Tab to switch category (or click the chips), Space for full-size preview, Enter to select, Esc to close. Scroll with the mouse wheel or PageUp/PageDown. `U` cycles the unlock animation and `Shift+U` its length, the same as clicking the Unlock chip in the header.

`A` picks a profile picture with the normal file dialog (the explorer steps aside while the
dialog is up and comes back when you are done), `Shift+A` clears it again. The designs that show
the user — Greeting Card, Split, Dock, Poster, Sheet, Island and Profile — use it, and fall back
to your initial when there is none.

With a fingerprint reader enrolled the lock screen listens for it as soon as it comes up, and
with face unlock set up (`pam_facelock`, the `omarchy-lock-face` PAM config with a model
enrolled) pressing Enter on an empty password field starts a face check, the same as the stock
lock. The password field shows an icon for each one that is available.

A security key works too, once you have enrolled one with the Omarchy menu (Setup > Security >
Fido2) and run `bash extras/setup-fido2.sh`. That script writes `/etc/pam.d/omarchy-lock-fido2`,
the only part of this that needs root. With a key plugged in, the lock comes up on the key: touch it,
or type its PIN first when the credential you enrolled asks for one. Tab, or the key icon in the
field, switches to the password and back.

Lock the screen with no key attached and you get the password field, with the key icon dimmed.
Plug one in and the lock picks it up within a couple of seconds and asks for a touch, unless you
had already switched to the password yourself or started typing.

The Settings tab in the explorer has a "Security key" row once the PAM service
is there. Off keeps the setting with your other lock screen settings and sends the lock
screen back to the password. Your PAM setup and your enrolled key are left alone, so the key
still works for sudo, polkit and anything else that uses it.

The key gets its own PAM service on purpose. A `pam_u2f.so` line in `omarchy-lock-password` would
send every mistyped password to the key as a PIN attempt, and a key locks itself out after eight
of those. So the password field is inert while pam_u2f is actually waiting for a touch, and
nothing you type then can reach the key. Press Enter to ask for another go: a failed attempt can
cost a PIN retry, so nothing retries on its own. After three PIN attempts in one lock the screen
stops offering the key and asks for the password: the key itself refuses further PINs at that
point until it is replugged, and the rest of its retries are not the lock screen's to spend. With
no key attached the field takes your password as normal. `bash extras/setup-fido2.sh --remove`
takes the PAM file out again.

One thing to decide at enrollment: a credential made without PIN verification unlocks the screen
for whoever is holding the key, the same as it does for sudo today. If the key travels in the same
bag as the laptop, enroll it with a PIN.

`D` opens the visual designer — a new design, or the selected one if it was made there (see
[The designer](#the-designer)). `C` on any design copies it to `~/.config/omarchy/lock-designs/`
(it shows up under Custom) and opens it in the built-in code editor. `E` edits a design of your
own, in the designer or the code editor depending on where it came from. `N` starts a new one
from the template. `X` (or the
Delete button on the card) removes a design of your own — press it twice, the first press just
arms the button. Deleting a clip design also removes its video from `~/.config/omarchy/lock-videos/`
unless something else still uses it (another design, the boot screen, the Motion video or the
unlock clip). Built-in designs can't be deleted. The editor has the code on
the left and a live preview on the right: Ctrl+S saves and reloads the preview and the lock screen, Ctrl+O opens
the file in your normal editor (changes made there are picked up too), Esc goes back.

To get it in the app launcher and the Omarchy menu (Style -> Lock Screen, and `lock` in the
menu's search), set "Omarchy menu" to Added in the Settings tab. Nothing is added on install: a
plugin cannot run anything when it is installed, so it is a choice you make once. The same by hand,
with `--remove` to take both entries out again:

```sh
~/.config/omarchy/plugins/io.github.sirjul1337.lock-explorer/extras/install.sh   # --remove takes them out
omarchy-shell lock setMenuEntry on   # or off
```

Optional keybinding for `~/.config/hypr/bindings.lua`:

```lua
o.bind("SUPER + SHIFT + L", "Lock screen explorer", "omarchy-shell lock explore")
```

Other commands:

```sh
omarchy-shell lock designs
omarchy-shell lock design
omarchy-shell lock setDesign zen
omarchy-shell lock previewDesign split   # you can type in the preview
omarchy-shell lock previewFail           # show the failure state in the preview
omarchy-shell lock hidePreview
omarchy-shell lock monitors
omarchy-shell lock setInputMonitor DP-1  # or "all"
omarchy-shell lock avatar
omarchy-shell lock pickAvatar            # the file dialog, same as A in the explorer
omarchy-shell lock setAvatar ~/me.png
omarchy-shell lock clearAvatar           # back to the initial
omarchy-shell lock resetAvatar           # back to whatever is found automatically
omarchy-shell lock unlockAnimation
omarchy-shell lock setUnlockAnimation fade   # none (default), fade, zoom or rise
omarchy-shell lock setUnlockDuration 600     # milliseconds, 0-2000, 400 by default
omarchy-shell lock previewUnlock             # play it on an open preview
omarchy-shell lock clockFormat
omarchy-shell lock setClockFormat 12   # or 24
omarchy-shell lock menuEntry
omarchy-shell lock setMenuEntry on     # launcher + Omarchy menu entries, or off
omarchy-shell lock boot
omarchy-shell lock setBoot follow            # stock, follow, or a design id with a twin
```

With more than one monitor you can pick which one shows the sign-in with `setInputMonitor`.
The others get a clock only screen (typing still works there).

The unlock is instant unless you ask for an animation. The Unlock chip in the explorer header
turns one on -- click it to cycle, click the milliseconds next to it for the length, or use `U`
and `Shift+U`. With one on, the lock screen animates away rather than blinking out: the design fades into the plain wallpaper and the desktop is behind it on the
same background. `fade` dissolves it, `zoom` fades with a slight push in and `rise` lifts it off
the screen, `none` is the default instant one. `setUnlockDuration` takes milliseconds.
`previewUnlock` plays the animation on the preview so you can see it without locking. The lock
screen is held for the duration of the animation, so keep it short.

Hyprland paints black under the lock screen, which is why the plain wallpaper is drawn behind the
fade: the desktop comes back on the same background instead of through a dark flash. With
`misc:session_lock_xray = true` the compositor keeps drawing the desktop under the lock screen
instead, and the fade goes straight into it.

The selected design, the avatar, the unlock animation and the boot screen setting are saved on
the plugin entry in `~/.config/omarchy/shell.json`.

### 12-hour clock

Clocks read 24-hour by default. The Settings tab has a "Clock" row — **24h** or
**12h AM/PM** — and it applies to every design, built-in or your own, including
the previews in the explorer and the designer canvas. By hand:
`omarchy-shell lock setClockFormat 12`, and `24` to go back. It is saved on the
plugin entry in `~/.config/omarchy/shell.json` as `clock12`.

Designs render their clock through `lock.clock("HH:mm")` rather than
`Qt.formatTime` directly, which is what lets one setting reach all of them: the
format is used as written on a 24-hour clock, and rewritten to a 12-hour one
with AM/PM after the time when the setting is on. A design that shows a bare
hour on its own — Flip's tiles, Poster's numerals — counts 1 to 12 and puts the
meridiem in `lock.meridiem`, which those two draw beside the digits.

### Blank the display after

By default the lock screen DPMS-offs the display five seconds after locking. The Settings tab has
a "Blank the display after" row — 5s, 15s, 30s, 1m, 5m, Custom, or Never. Custom takes minutes
(1 to 60) typed into an inline field. By hand: `omarchy-shell lock setBlankDelay 30000`, or
`setKeepDisplayOn true` for Never — anything longer than an hour is what Never is for.

**Never** keeps the lock screen lit for the whole lock: video designs keep playing, and slow
monitors are never re-blanked mid-wake on resume — the display was never off to begin with.

For an HDMI setup that fails to wake after DPMS, you can instead keep displays powered
**only while HDMI is present**. Add `"keepDisplaysOnWithHdmi": true` to this plugin's
entry in `~/.config/omarchy/shell.json`:

```json
{"id": "io.github.sirjul1337.lock-explorer", "keepDisplaysOnWithHdmi": true}
```

This defaults off. While an `HDMI-A-*` screen is present, the blank timer turns off
only the keyboard backlight; all displays stay powered and the lock remains active.
When HDMI is removed, the normal blank delay starts again. **Never** still keeps
displays on regardless of connectors. Set the HDMI option to `false` or remove it
to disable the workaround. `omarchy-shell lock status` reports the effective policy
as `displayBlankingSuppressed`.

This uses more monitor power. It avoids a display-sleep trigger; it does not fix
driver hotplug faults or prevent explicit system suspend. The setting follows
Hyprland's visible HDMI screen names, not USB dock presence.

Some monitors disconnect when they go to sleep, and with no output left the shell can
crash while the screen is locked. The lock always comes back after a crash like that. If
the shell went down with the display off, it keeps the displays on for the rest of the
login instead of blanking again, so it happens at most once. The shell log then shows
`blank-crashed: keeping displays on for this login`, and `displayBlankingSuppressed`
reads `true`. Logging out or rebooting resets it. On a monitor that does this every
time, pick **Never**.

With no avatar set, the first of `~/.config/omarchy/lock-avatar.{png,jpg,jpeg,webp}`, `~/.face`,
`~/.face.icon` and `/var/lib/AccountsService/icons/$USER` is used, so an existing profile picture
shows up on its own.

## Boot screen (drive decryption) — experimental

The boot screen support is experimental: it works and fails safe (a broken theme drops
Plymouth to its plain text prompt, and the boot itself is never touched), but it is younger
than the rest of the plugin.

The screen that asks for your disk passphrase at first boot is Plymouth, not the shell, so it
normally stays the stock Omarchy one no matter which design you pick. Designs with a boot twin
under `plymouth/` -- Terminal and Rain so far -- can style it too. Press `B` in the explorer (or
click the Boot screen chip) and pick "Match lock screen" to keep it in sync with your lock
design, pick a specific design to pin it, or "Untouched" to restore the stock one.

Applying generates a Plymouth theme from your current Omarchy theme colors and ships it as a
systemd-stub initrd addon on the EFI partition (`omarchy_linux.efi.extra.d/`), which the boot
stub layers over the boot image -- one small file write, near-instant, one password prompt, no
initramfs rebuild. The first apply after updating from an older version of this plugin also
cleans up the previously baked-in theme, which runs one last rebuild (~30s). Colors are baked
into the addon at apply time, so re-apply after switching Omarchy theme (the explorer offers
this automatically). If a generated theme ever misbehaves the boot itself is fine -- Plymouth
falls back to a plain text prompt -- "Untouched" deletes the addon and the stock screen is back.
Snapshot boot entries never see the addon, so rollbacks always show the stock theme. Systems
that don't boot Omarchy's UKI keep the old bake-and-rebuild path automatically.

The twins are honest ports, not screenshots: Terminal keeps the blinking cursor, the bullets and
a caps lock warning, Rain keeps the falling glyphs, animated live by plymouth. Clocks and live
data can't come along (Plymouth has no clock and boots before the network), which is why not
every design has a twin.

You can try a twin without touching your boot:

```sh
extras/boot-vm-test.sh "$(plymouth/apply.sh terminal --stage-only)"
```

boots your real kernel and initramfs in QEMU against a throwaway encrypted disk (passphrase:
`omarchy`). Needs `qemu-system-x86`, `edk2-ovmf` and `qemu-ui-gtk`.

## The designer

"+ New design" in the explorer sidebar (or `D`) opens the visual designer: pieces on the left,
your lock screen at its real size in the middle, the settings for whatever is selected on the
right. Drag a piece onto the screen — or click it to drop one in the middle — move it around,
and press Ctrl+S. There is no separate preview: the canvas renders through the same components
the lock screen does, so what you arrange is what you get.

What you can drag in: **Wallpaper**, **Video** and **Solid color** for the background; **Clock**,
**Date**, **Greeting**, **Text**, **User name**, **Host name** and a **Status line** that turns
into the failure message when a password is wrong; a **Password box** or bare **Dots** to type
into; **Avatar** and **Image**; **Panel** and **Divider** to build a card out of; and **Custom
QML** for anything else — that one is a box you write QML into, with `lock.now`, `lock.userName`,
`lock.greeting()` and the rest in scope, exactly as in a hand-written design.

Nothing is parked at fixed pixel coordinates. Every piece holds on to a corner, an edge or the
middle of the screen ("Sticks to" in the inspector, picked from where you drop it) and keeps its
distance from there, so a design made on one screen still looks right on another. Dragging snaps
to the screen's centre lines and to the other pieces' edges, and arrow keys nudge by a pixel
(Shift for ten).

```
drag / click a piece   add it            Ctrl+click       add to the selection
arrows                 nudge (Shift 10)  Ctrl+D           duplicate
Del                    remove            [ and ]          send back / bring forward
Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Shift+Z  undo / redo       Ctrl+S           save
```

### Your own components

Select a piece — or several with Ctrl — press **Save as component** and give it a name. It goes
into `~/.config/omarchy/lock-components/` as one small JSON file and shows up at the top of the
palette, previewed live, ready to drag into any design from then on. A component keeps the
relative positions of everything in it, so a card built out of a panel, an avatar and a greeting
comes back as that card. Backgrounds are not saved into components — they cover the whole screen,
so there is nothing to place. The `✕` on a component removes it.

Because a component is just a piece of a layout, a Custom QML piece can be saved as one too:
write the QML once, name it, and it becomes a block you drag in like any other.

### What it writes

The designer saves an ordinary design into `~/.config/omarchy/lock-designs/`, so it appears under
Custom next to everything else and can be applied, previewed and deleted the same way. The file is
a `DesignBase` with one `DesignerItem` per piece, and the layout itself sits on a single comment
line at the top — that line is what the designer reads when you open the design again. **Edit the
code by hand and the next save from the designer overwrites it**, so pick one: "Edit code" in the
designer toolbar moves a design over to the code editor for good, and `E` on a design opens it
wherever it was made.

## Your own designs

Easiest: open the explorer, pick a design you like and press `C`. That copies it to
`~/.config/omarchy/lock-designs/` and opens the editor. `N` gives you a blank one from
`extras/lock-designs/MyDesign.qml`. You can also just drop `.qml` files in that folder yourself;
they show up under Custom, named after the file (`My Design` for `MyDesign.qml`, id `my-mydesign`).

```sh
omarchy-shell lock customize zen        # copy the Zen design to ~/.config/omarchy/lock-designs/Zen.qml
omarchy-shell lock editDesign my-zen    # open it in your editor
omarchy-shell lock rescanDesigns        # pick up files added by hand
```

Keep the `import "../plugins/io.github.sirjul1337.lock-explorer/designs"` line, that is where
`DesignBase`, `PasswordField`, `LockInput`, `Wallpaper` and `Avatar` come from.

Your own video works as an unlock clip too: "+ New clip" in the explorer sidebar (or
`omarchy-shell lock newClipDesign`) opens the file picker, copies the video to
`~/.config/omarchy/lock-videos/` and writes a one-line design for it, which shows up under
Animation. Like Storm and the others, the first frame holds while locked and the video plays
through as the unlock — so a clip that ends on your wallpaper looks best. By hand it is just a
file in `~/.config/omarchy/lock-designs/` containing
`ClipDesign { clipName: "my-video.mp4" }` after the import line.

"Unlock video ends as your wallpaper" under Settings makes any clip end seamlessly: the clip's
last frame is extracted while the screen is locked and set as the session background
(`omarchy-theme-bg-set`) the moment the video hands the screen back, so the desktop opens exactly
where the video stopped. Switching theme or cycling backgrounds replaces it again like any other
wallpaper. Off by default; also from the command line:

```sh
omarchy-shell lock setClipWallpaper true
```

"Clip speed" next to it plays the unlock clips faster or slower (0.5x-2x, also
`omarchy-shell lock setClipSpeed 1.5`). It applies to the clip designs and the separate unlock
clip alike.

To add a design to the plugin itself, copy one of the files in `designs/`, add it to
`Designs.js`, run `omarchy restart shell`.

A design is a `DesignBase` item. It gets `passwordText`, `failureMessage`, `failedAttempts`,
`authenticatingPassword`, `fingerprintConfigured`, `faceConfigured`, `fido2Configured`,
`fido2Active`, `fido2Authenticating`, `fido2NeedsPin`, `fido2Status`, `inputEnabled`, a ticking `now`, `userName`,
`hostName` and `greeting()`. Use `PasswordField` for a normal input box or `LockInput` if you
want to draw the input yourself, and point `inputItem` at it so it gets focus. Set
`shakeOnFail: true` on box-less designs (the base flashes red on a wrong password either way), and
`showPasswordToggle: false` if you do not want the eye button.

For the profile picture use `Avatar { lock: lock; width: 96 }`, which shows the chosen image
masked to a circle and the user's initial when there is none. `fontSize`, `fillColor`,
`textColor`, `borderWidth`, `borderColor` and `shadow` are there to fit it into a design. The raw
values are on the base as `hasAvatar` and `avatarUrl` if you want to draw it yourself.

## Remove

```sh
omarchy plugin remove io.github.sirjul1337.lock-explorer
omarchy restart shell
```

That restores the built-in Omarchy lock screen. Your own designs in
`~/.config/omarchy/lock-designs/` are left alone, delete that folder if you want them gone.
The optional launcher entry from `extras/install.sh` can be removed with
`rm ~/.local/share/applications/lock-screen-explorer.desktop ~/.local/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/lock-screen-explorer.svg`
and by deleting the `style.lockscreen` line from `~/.config/omarchy/extensions/omarchy-menu.jsonc`.

## Troubleshooting

`omarchy-shell lock explore` says `Function not found`: the stock lock service is still the one
answering, so this plugin never took over the `lock` IPC target. Run `omarchy restart shell`.
If it persists, check that the plugin is enabled and that the stock one got disabled:

```sh
omarchy plugin list
jq '.plugins, .disabled' ~/.config/omarchy/shell.json
```

`io.github.sirjul1337.lock-explorer` should be enabled and `omarchy.lock` should be in `disabled`.

`Target not found` instead means neither service is loaded, usually because this one failed to
load. `omarchy plugin validate ~/.config/omarchy/plugins/io.github.sirjul1337.lock-explorer`
and the shell log will say why.

The explorer opens but nothing in it works, and every setting comes back as its default after
`omarchy restart shell` or an update: that is plugin versions up to 1.6.1 on Omarchy 4.0.3,
which stopped handing third-party plugins their `shell.json` settings and, for a lock screen,
their own service. Update the plugin (`omarchy plugin update io.github.sirjul1337.lock-explorer`
then `omarchy restart shell`); 1.7.0 reads its entry from `~/.config/omarchy/shell.json` itself
and hands the explorer a facade of the service instead. Settings that were lost in the meantime
need to be picked again once.

A broken design can never lock you out: if the selected design fails to load (a custom design
with a typo, say), the lock screen falls back to Classic, and if even that fails a plain
built-in password field takes over — the password always works. The boot screen is equally
safe: a broken Plymouth theme drops to a plain text passphrase prompt, and the boot itself is
never touched. If the whole shell ever misbehaves, switch to a console with Ctrl+Alt+F3, log
in, and run `omarchy restart shell` (or `omarchy plugin remove io.github.sirjul1337.lock-explorer`).

Video designs fall back to Classic, or the clip designs and the unlock clip do nothing: stock
Omarchy ships Qt without the multimedia module, so anything that plays a video needs
`qt6-multimedia`. The rest of the plugin works without it (the shell log says
`qt6-multimedia is not installed`, and `omarchy-shell lock status` shows `"multimedia": false`).
Fix:

```sh
sudo pacman -S qt6-multimedia && omarchy restart shell
```

On plugin versions up to 1.5.1 the missing package took the whole service down, which is the
other way `Target not found` used to happen.

Designs show the theme color instead of your wallpaper (and the explorer header says the
wallpaper failed to load): stock Omarchy ships Qt without a WebP decoder, so `.webp` wallpapers
cannot be read by the shell even though the desktop shows them fine. Fix:

```sh
sudo pacman -S qt6-imageformats && omarchy restart shell
```

## Dependencies

The video features — the clip designs (Storm, Eyes, River and your own), the Motion design and
the unlock clip — need `qt6-multimedia`, which stock Omarchy does not install. Without it they
are simply disabled and everything else works (see Troubleshooting). Beyond that, nothing
outside Omarchy 4 itself, except the Weather design, which runs `curl` to fetch
`https://wttr.in` (the same service and location file as the Omarchy weather widget). No other
design makes network requests. Picking an avatar runs `omarchy file select`, the desktop file
chooser that ships with Omarchy. The plugin reads `~/.config/omarchy/shell.json` and writes
only its own entry in it (the design you pick, the path to your avatar and the other settings
above), plus files you create yourself under `~/.config/omarchy/lock-designs/`. Avatar images are read where they are,
nothing is copied.

Setting a boot screen uses tools Omarchy already ships (`magick`, `fc-match`, `pkexec`, `cpio`
and binutils' `objcopy`/`objdump` for the addon) and writes one file,
`/boot/EFI/Linux/omarchy_linux.efi.extra.d/omarchy-lock-explorer.addon.efi`, plus the
applied-state marker `~/.local/state/omarchy/lock-explorer-boot`. "Untouched" deletes the addon
again. On systems without Omarchy's UKI boot the legacy path bakes the theme into
`/usr/share/plymouth/themes/omarchy-boot/` with `plymouth-set-default-theme` and an initramfs
rebuild instead. The optional `extras/boot-vm-test.sh` and `extras/addon-vm-test.sh` need the
QEMU packages listed above and never touch the host.

## Credits

The unlock clips that ship with the clip designs — Storm, Eyes and River — were made by
[@yamzeight](https://x.com/yamzeight) on X and are included with his permission. Credit is
also shown on the cards in the explorer.

## License

MIT, see [LICENSE](LICENSE). `Service.qml` is based on the built-in `omarchy.lock` plugin from Omarchy (MIT).

## Development

```sh
omarchy plugin validate ~/.config/omarchy/plugins/io.github.sirjul1337.lock-explorer
qmllint -I "$OMARCHY_PATH/shell" ~/.config/omarchy/plugins/io.github.sirjul1337.lock-explorer/{*.qml,designs/*.qml}
omarchy restart shell
```

On Omarchy 4.0.3 and later the explorer, editor and designer do not get the service object
from the host (it is an authentication service, kept private). `Service.qml` publishes a
facade of itself through `Bridge.js` instead, with the settings, design state and actions the
UI needs and none of the PAM state. Anything new the UI reads off `service` has to be added to
that facade; `extras/test-service-api.py` (run in CI) fails when something is missing.

Every script that writes a file of the user's — design copies, imported clips, boot previews,
the launcher and menu entries — goes through `extras/safe-paths.sh`: the target must sit under
`$HOME` behind a chain of real, user-owned directories (a symlink anywhere in it stops the
script), and a file is replaced by writing a temporary next to it and renaming it into place.
Use `safe_dir` and `put_file` from there rather than `mkdir -p`, `cp` or `>` when adding one.

### Per-output locked idle power (fork)

The plugin entry in `shell.json` optionally accepts:
`"phasedPower": {"main":"DP-5","sides":["DP-4","DP-6"],"offMs":60000,"dimMs":300000,"overlayOpacity":0.35}`.
This overrides the legacy all-output blanking behavior. Main DPMS turns off after
one minute; both side-monitor DDC brightness values reach zero after five
minutes total and stay there without a repeating timer. A 35%-opaque optical
black overlay covers each side lock surface in that dim phase, above all
content, without intercepting input; it disappears immediately on activity
or unlock. `overlayOpacity` accepts 0 (disabled) through 0.95 (very dark).
Each brightness write is verified by VCP 10 readback. Failed detection probes
fall back to directly checking brightness on connector-matched candidate buses;
a failure on one side does not skip the other, and failures are reported.
On this machine both DP-4 and DP-6 were hardware-tested at 0 and restored to
their original 100; full-duration lock/overlay acceptance remains manual. Compositor input activity restores
power/original brightness and restarts both deadlines. QML pointer geometry
changes and authentication retries do not wake outputs in this mode. Unlock
also restores power. Requires Python 3, ddcutil, accessible I2C devices and
Hyprland's Lua per-monitor DPMS dispatcher (verified against v0.56.2).
Connector names are configured; DDC bus numbers are discovered dynamically.
Brightness is saved atomically and fsynced before dimming under
`${XDG_STATE_HOME:-~/.local/state}/omarchy/lock-explorer-power/`. This survives
logout/reboot: monitors may retain brightness 0 after power loss while runtime
directories disappear. Legacy runtime restore data is migrated when available.
On startup, once the compositor lock state is known to be unlocked, the service
restores saved brightness automatically, with at most five bounded attempts.
Failed/missing-output restores retain their saved values for later recovery.
Before disabling/removing or restarting the shell, unlock normally to restore
brightness, or run `python3 display-power.py wake DP-5 DP-4 DP-6` from this
checkout in the desktop session. Removing `phasedPower` returns to legacy
blanking; do this only while unlocked. Other display-power daemons conflict.
Tests: `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py'` and
`node --test tests/*.cjs`. Physical five-minute timing, input wake, suspend and
hotplug require desktop acceptance; hardware failures are logged, not retried
in a tight loop.
